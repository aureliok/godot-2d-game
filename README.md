# Space Arcade Shooter using Godot

## Introduction
This project was developed due to my interest in testing Godot, a open-source game engine, and learn how programming is used in a game development context.
The core objective of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible, while shooting the enemies that appear on the edge of the screen.


## Game Mechanics
The player can:
- Shoot (mouse left-click);
- Use a power shot (mouse right-click) after gathering 3 power up orbs;
- Use a shield for defense (spacebar) if there's enough shield energy, represented by the bar on the bottom;

The game will end if the player gets touched by a enemy or it's projectile.
